Possible locations had to be placed on agricultural, barren or vegetated lands, could not be within 100m of a river or lake, could only be placed on areas of low slope and had to be within 300m of road.


Suitable Landuse Sites were identified and depicted using Vector GIS and DEM (Digital Elevation Modelling).
